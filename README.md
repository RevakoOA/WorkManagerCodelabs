(1_workmanager_starter) WorkManager Codelab
===================================

`1_workmanager_starter` module contains the code for the [WorkManager Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-workmanager).

Notes:
- The application code contains a battery not low constraint. If the device/emulator has a low battery, the application will appear to hang until this constraint is met.
- The app requires notifications to be enabled. To enable notifications, navigate to the Android Settings menu > Apps > Blur-O-Matic > Notifications > Enable "All Blur-O-Matic notifications".
